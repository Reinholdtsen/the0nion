In a remarkable display of unified absurdity, the American populace took to the streets today to bark like dogs. But these were no ordinary barks. Rather than the expected "woof" or "arf", citizens nationwide proudly shouted "Hey!" into the void, marking the observance of the now-viral National Hey Day. 

With origins clouded in the mysteries of internet virality, National Hey Day has emerged as the latest excuse for adults to behave like slightly unhinged, yet remarkably happy, children. "The beauty of this event is its utter senselessness," stated Greg Mendelson, a 37-year-old accountant who spent his lunch break barking 'Hey!' in the park. "We are humans, not dogs, and yet here we are, barking at each other. It's ridiculous and I love it."

Even corporate America, not known for its frivolity, has embraced this eccentric celebration. Numerous reports surfaced of boardroom meetings being interrupted by a chorus of "Hey!" barks, followed by laughter and a marked improvement in workplace morale.

But it's not all fun and games. Controversy has arisen around the proper technique of 'Hey!' barking, with self-proclaimed Hey-Bark Purists insisting on an elongated, plaintive 'Hey!', while the Urban Hey Group favors a brisk, jovial version. Yet, despite these minor scuffles, National Hey Day continues to thrive.

"There's just something primal about going outside and hollering into the universe, waiting for an echo," said Professor Linda Choi, an anthropologist studying modern digital trends. "Even if that echo is a fellow human, in a business suit, barking 'Hey!' right back at you."

As the sun set on another successful National Hey Day, the barks began to quiet. The nation took a collective breath and then, as if on cue, a resounding "Hey!" rang out, a reminder of our shared human capacity for connection, laughter, and a little bit of madness. 

So, until next year, stay hoarse, America. May your 'Hey!' be loud and your return echoes be many.
