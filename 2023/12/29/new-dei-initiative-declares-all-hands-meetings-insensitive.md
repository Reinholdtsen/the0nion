In what's being hailed as a landmark victory for inclusivity, MegaCorp Inc. has announced a new diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiative that is shaking up the corporate world. The initiative includes a comprehensive ban on the phrase "All Hands" meeting, deeming it insensitive to individuals without hands.

The announcement came during what was formerly known as an "All Hands" meeting, but has now been rebranded as an "All Presence" gathering. This shift aims to foster a more inclusive environment for employees who might feel excluded by the traditional terminology.

"Our goal is to create a workspace where everyone feels welcomed and valued, regardless of their physical abilities," explained Samantha Leaps, head of DEI at MegaCorp. "We realized the phrase 'All Hands' could be alienating for our handless colleagues. It's high time we adapted our language to be as inclusive as possible."

The initiative has received mixed reactions from the public and employees alike. Some praise the company for its forward-thinking approach, while others argue it's an overreach into corporate language policing.

"I never really thought about it before," commented Mark Grasps, a longtime employee. "But now that it's been pointed out, I can see how it might be off-putting. It's a small change, but if it makes even one person feel more included, why not?"

Critics, however, see it as a step too far. "It's political correctness gone mad," argued another employee who wished to remain anonymous. "What's next? Banning the term 'foot traffic' because it's insensitive to those who can't walk?"

Despite the controversy, MegaCorp remains committed to its new initiative. In addition to the language change, the company is also introducing mandatory workshops on inclusive language and sensitivity training for all employees.

"This is just the beginning," Leaps said. "We're reviewing all aspects of our corporate communication to ensure it aligns with our values of inclusivity and respect. It's not just about changing words; it's about changing mindsets."

Whether other companies will follow MegaCorp's lead remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the conversation around inclusivity in corporate culture has taken a significant, if not unconventional, turn.
