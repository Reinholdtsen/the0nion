**NEW YORK**â€”In a desperate attempt to salvage their reputation and sales, the company behind the controversial snake trapeze product 'Herpeze' announced Monday that they were launching a campaign to find a new name for their product after receiving widespread criticism and ridicule from consumers.

"We admit that we made a huge mistake with the name 'Herpeze'," said CEO of ReptiFun, Inc., Martin Jenkins, in a press conference. "We thought it was a clever and catchy way to combine 'herpetology' and 'trapeze', but we failed to consider the negative associations that many people have with the word 'herpes'. We apologize for any offense or confusion we may have caused, and we are eager to hear your suggestions for a better name."

Jenkins said that the company had set up a website where customers could submit their ideas for a new name, and that they would select the best one by the end of the month. He also defended the quality and safety of the product, which he claimed was designed to provide "fun and exercise" for snakes of all sizes and species.

"Herpeze is a revolutionary product that allows your snake to swing, climb, and coil on a sturdy metal frame that can be attached to any cage or enclosure," Jenkins said. "It's a great way to enrich your snake's environment and stimulate their natural behaviors. It's also easy to assemble and clean, and comes with a lifetime warranty."

However, many customers and animal rights activists were not convinced by Jenkins' pitch, and expressed their outrage and disgust at the product and its name on social media.

"This is the most ridiculous and offensive thing I've ever seen," wrote one Twitter user. "Who would buy this for their snake? And who would name it 'Herpeze'? Do they think it's funny to mock people with herpes? Do they think snakes have herpes? Do they even care about snakes at all?"

"This is animal cruelty, plain and simple," wrote another. "Snakes are not toys, they are living beings that deserve respect and care. Forcing them to perform circus tricks on a metal contraption is not fun or exercise, it's torture. And calling it 'Herpeze' is just adding insult to injury. Shame on you, ReptiFun."

Jenkins said that he hoped that the name change would help restore the public's trust and interest in his product, and that he was confident that there was a market for snake trapezes.

"We believe that there are many snake owners out there who love their pets and want to provide them with the best possible care and entertainment," Jenkins said. "We just need to find a name that reflects that. Maybe something like 'Serpent Swing' or 'Coil-A-Rama'. Or maybe you have a better idea. Let us know at www.herpeze.com."
