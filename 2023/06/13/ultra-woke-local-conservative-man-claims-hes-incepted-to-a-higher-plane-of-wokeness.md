Springfield, Missouri â€“ Jeb "Family Values" Johnson has thrown the political compass for a loop as he redefines the concept of 'woke.' The staunch conservative has claimed that he is more 'woke' than anyone on the political spectrum, insisting that he has journeyed to a higher plane of social consciousness in an Inception-like twist that has thrown locals into a whirlpool of bewildered amusement.

Johnson, who is as conservative as they come, is a paradox within a paradox. Known for his fiery speeches on the sanctity of traditional values, Johnson is now turning heads with his new twist on the progressive term 'woke.' He's not just awake; he's woke within woke, in what he refers to as the ultimate inception.

"I've entered the dream, navigated through various layers, kicked myself awake, and reached a state of wokeness that transcends the regular understanding of the term," Johnson explained, misinterpreting several key plot points from Christopher Nolan's film Inception. "It's like when DiCaprio goes into the dream within the dream, except for me, it's being woke within woke."

The local conservative has created a mind-bending narrative, sparking debate and bewilderment among residents of Springfield. "It's like watching Inception for the first time. You're confused, a bit intrigued, and not sure if you're following it correctly," said Greg Thompson, a local baker and a perplexed observer of the ongoing saga.

Johnson's reinterpretation of 'woke' has left both sides of the aisle questioning their grasp of the term. "We thought we were woke, but are we now unwoke?" questioned Lily Adams, a local progressive activist. "Did Johnson just incept us into being unwoke? I swear this is the kind of stuff that makes spinning tops wobble."

Even fellow conservatives are left puzzled. Chuck "Gun Rights" Miller admitted, "It's like he's gone off into a distant dream and we're stuck here in reality, or are we in the dream? I need a top to tell me what's what."

Despite the confusion, Johnson is showing no signs of slowing down. He recently concluded a typical conservative rally with the now-infamous line, "Wake up, get woke, and then wake up again, patriots!"

It remains to be seen how this deeper-than-deep inception of wokeness will impact the political landscape of Springfield, or even the country. All we can do is wait and see if the spinning top will ever stop, or if Johnson's revolutionary brand of ultra-wokeness will become the new reality.
