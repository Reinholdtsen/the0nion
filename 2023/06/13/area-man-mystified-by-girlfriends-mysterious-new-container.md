GRAND RAPIDS, MIâ€”Sources confirmed Monday that local man Jeff Naber, 33, was plunged into a state of profound confusion and existential dread upon discovering an ambiguously purposed container recently purchased by his girlfriend, Stacey Kuhns, 31.

According to reports, Naber was first alerted to the small, oval-shaped, multicolored object while clearing space on the coffee table for his Thursday night Taco Bell feast. His initial excitement over the potential discovery of a hidden cache of "maybe candy" quickly gave way to confusion and, ultimately, fear. 

"What in the world is this thing for?" wondered Naber, as he studied the container which possessed a size inconvenient enough to elude any straightforward classification. "It could fit lipsticks or those tiny sewing things she has, or maybe even pills. Or is it a mini-urn for a deceased pet hamster? God, I hope not."

Unconfirmed reports suggest that Naber even went so far as to shake the container next to his ear in a futile attempt to determine its contents by sound. His bewildered countenance seemed to darken even further when this strategy yielded no insight beyond a muffled rattle.

Sources close to the couple reported that Naber had briefly considered opening the container to solve the mystery, but feared the consequences of possibly breaking some unspoken girlfriend code.

"He's been pacing around the living room for the past half hour, muttering things like 'It's too light to be a makeup kit but too heavy to be sewing materials,'" Kuhns said, her bemusement only deepening her boyfriend's distress. "He even googled 'multifunctional women's containers' at some point. I saw it in his search history."

In an attempt to assuage his mounting panic, Naber reportedly consulted with friends via group text, forwarding a hastily taken, somewhat blurry image of the object in question. Their wildly varied responses, ranging from "It's obviously a portable sewing kit, dude" to "Nah, bro, she's organizing her prescription meds" and even "I bet it's one of those feminine witchcraft things," did little to settle his mind.

By press time, Naber had spent an exhausting three hours attempting to crack the enigma of the container, a period in which he could have watched an entire Lord of the Rings movie or built a small shed from scratch. 

While his struggle continues, Naber remains hopeful that his girlfriend will eventually take pity on him and reveal the purpose of the perplexing item. 

"Or she could, you know, just move it off the coffee table," he added. "That'd work too." 

As of publication, the container remains unopened, its contents unknown, a quiet testament to the enduring mysteries of the feminine world that continue to befuddle men everywhere.
