content_prompt: Write an article about a physicist / software developer that is unreasonably annoyed with hexadecimal notation and the term "polyamory" because they are both Frankenteaus (a portmanteau of Frankenstein and portmanteau), a mix of decimals and letters, and a mixture of greek and latin roots. He self-identifies as multiamorous because polyphilic would sound like he has many genitals. Whenever something annoys him, he invents something different. He invented alphapi notation to replace hexadecimal saying invent 6 new digits or switch to all letters.

**STANFORD UNIVERSITY**â€”Unconventional, innovative, and decidedly particular, Dr. Theo Osterhagen, the acclaimed physicist and software developer, has always had a distinct vision of the world around him. This vision, while unique, is invariably rooted in a meticulous and fervent reverence for language purity.

"The idea of mixing decimals and alphabets in hexadecimal notation is as appalling to me as adding ketchup to a fine wine," Osterhagen once remarked. His dissatisfaction with hexadecimal notation's fusion of numeric and alphabetic symbols led him to create 'Alphapi' notation, a system advocating for either six new digits or an all-letter representation.

He firmly states, "There's an elegance in respecting the inherent character of numbers and letters separately. Mixing them up creates an uncomfortable chimerical entity." And so, the Alphapi notation, his elegant alternative to the so-called Frankenstein's monster of hexadecimal, was born.

Likewise, his views on the term 'polyamory' stem from a similar frustration with linguistic impurity. "Polyamory - it's like forcing a square peg into a round hole. Greek and Latin are both beautiful languages. Why mash them together like that?"

Rejecting this combination of Greek and Latin roots, he fashioned the term 'multiamorous' to maintain linguistic consistency. "Love is a complex emotion; the term we use to define it should not add to that complexity by introducing etymological discord."

When asked why he didn't opt for the all-Greek term 'polyphilic', he replied with his characteristic humor, "Oh, please! I don't want to leave room for misinterpretations. Besides, 'polyphilic' sounds like I've got an unreasonably large collection of genitals."

Dr. Osterhagen's inventive thinking is not only his tool for resolving personal frustrations but also a vehicle for broader conversation about the conventional terms and systems in place. "Discomfort is an interesting sensation. It signals the necessity for change. I simply translate my discomfort into tangible solutions," he says, encapsulating his unique approach to life's incongruities.

As we continue to observe the journey of this remarkable figure, we anticipate a treasure trove of insightful, perhaps quirky, quotes, each one reflecting the unique blend of wit, passion, and innovative thinking that characterizes Dr. Theo Osterhagen. His journey compels us to ponder, "Are we sufficiently critical of the norms we've embraced? Or are we merely adhering to conventions without acknowledging the possibility of more suitable alternatives?" It's a question that Osterhagen lives to explore and answer.
