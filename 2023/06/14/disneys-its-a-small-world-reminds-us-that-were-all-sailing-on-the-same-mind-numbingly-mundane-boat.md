Disney has once again boarded the nostalgia train, or should we say the world's slowest moving boat ride, for a big-screen adaptation of its famed Disneyland theme park ride, "It's a Small World". In a feat of corporate synergy rivaled only by Mickey Mouse's iron-fisted grasp on copyright law, the movie navigates the perilous waters of global unity, revealing a world united by their shared love of stereotypically nationalistic puppetry.

“It’s A Small World” is a cinematic marvel, a film that, much like its theme park counterpart, fully embraces its deeply entrenched commitment to delivering a ceaseless and unvarying parade of anthropomorphized culture. As you navigate through its ambitious narrative, you’ll feel your brain slowly disconnecting from your senses, a process as inevitable as the looping anthem that grinds on your eardrums until you’re ready to plead for sweet silence.

Director Betty Spielberg, sister of Steven Spielberg’s cousin’s friend’s dog’s walker, employs a pastiche of styles that pay tribute to every major cinematic tradition, from French New Wave to Hollywood Golden Age to some questionable interpretations of Bollywood. The end result is a stunning mosaic of conflicting and jarring visual languages that is nothing short of an unmitigated mess. 

The film's plot, which loosely follows a group of international children trapped on a seemingly never-ending boat ride, leans heavily into its source material. The young protagonists are perpetually stuck in an effervescent limbo, singing the same refrain on repeat until it burrows into your consciousness like a tick with a particularly catchy tune. 

The most impressive thing about “It’s A Small World” is its all-consuming commitment to its theme. The screenwriters truly distilled the essence of the theme park ride, delivering an experience so authentically monotonous that you'll leave the theater questioning your own sanity. The characters are so thinly developed and uniformly cheerful that they're less believable as human beings and more akin to, well, animatronic puppets.

The film’s token attempt at addressing world peace is admirable, but the depth of understanding it brings to international relations is akin to saying that world hunger could be solved by everyone having a cheeseburger. Indeed, the underlying message of the film appears to be that if we just stick to our own cultural clichés and sing about unity, all global conflicts will magically evaporate. 

In conclusion, "It's A Small World" is as repetitive, insipid, and grating as the theme park ride that inspired it. However, in its relentless monotony and bafflingly simplistic view of global culture, it serves as a fitting tribute to the enduring theme park attraction. It may not be a good film, but it is unquestionably a faithful adaptation. And in today's world, isn't that worth celebrating? Or, at the very least, worth suffering through 90 minutes of song that will haunt your dreams for weeks to come.
