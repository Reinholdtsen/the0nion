PLYMOUTH, MN - In a turn of events that stunned precisely nobody but himself, local man, Brad "Big Love" Jenkins, is reportedly baffled by his friends' assertions that his enthusiastic pursuit of polyamorous relationships with an ever-growing list of women may be viewed as selfish.

In his quest to redefine love and relationships, Jenkins, a 32-year-old software engineer, maintains a steady rotation of no fewer than five romantic partners. However, this modern-day Casanova expressed bewilderment as to why he's come under fire for his lifestyle choices.

"I just don't get it," Jenkins lamented over a beer at his local haunt, the Snuggle Inn, where the bar staff know his favorite drink and his preferred dates. "All I'm trying to do is spread love and joy to as many women as possible. How could that be seen as anything but altruistic?"

Friends of the self-proclaimed polyamory ambassador say they've tried to explain the situation to him, but to no avail.

"We keep telling Brad that it's not the multiple partners thing," said long-time friend, Gary Dunkirk. "It's more about the fact that he refuses to listen to Celine Dion songs, refuses to hold hands during movies, and won't commit to anyone's birthday. He'll date five women, but can't remember a single anniversary. It's not about polyamory, it's about him being a bit of a jerk."

Jenkins, whose Tinder bio proudly proclaims "monogamy is monotony," remains convinced that he is a champion of modern, progressive love. He dismisses critiques, stating his partners are "totally on board with sharing this irresistible slice of man-pie."

Meanwhile, Jenkins' most recent addition to his roster, a 26-year-old veterinary technician named Melanie, offered a different perspective. "It was fun at first," she confessed, "until I realized I get less time with him than my cat gets with its scratching post."

In a stunning display of cognitive dissonance, Jenkins believes his issue isn't with the distribution of time and emotional investment, but with societal norms. "It's a misunderstanding caused by society's oppressive expectations," he declared. "I am not a one-woman kind of man, but I am a five-women kind of man who doesn't see why that's a problem."

As of press time, Jenkins was reportedly setting up a Google Calendar to track all his dates, birthdays, and anniversaries, utterly convinced that this alone would solve all accusations of his selfishness. But friends, partners, and even his weary mother remained skeptical, suggesting that perhaps the problem was not in the scheduling, but in the man doing the scheduling.

Satire aside, it remains evident that while polyamory might work for some, it requires a level of emotional maturity, communication, and empathy that seems to have gone over Jenkins' curly-haired head.
