CHICAGO— In a startling and grim revelation, the esteemed board of the International Doomsday Clock has indicated that humanity is now a mere 'three Chuck Norris jokes away' from total annihilation.

The clock, a symbolic measure of mankind's closeness to self-destruction, typically factors in elements like nuclear threat, climate change, and biological warfare. However, the sudden influx of recycled Chuck Norris memes, primarily on the internet, has now been considered a valid threat to human existence.

"Each time a Chuck Norris joke is posted, tweeted, or casually mentioned at the water cooler, the world moves ominously closer to oblivion," warned Dr. Ivan Zanuck, Chairman of the Doomsday Clock Committee. "Even as we speak, somewhere on the planet, someone is probably typing, 'Chuck Norris doesn’t wear a watch. He decides what time it is.' It's a chilling reality."

The committee explains that the so-called 'Roundhouse Kick Factor' – a metric developed specifically to quantify the danger posed by Chuck Norris humor – is at an all-time high. Zanuck said, "The world is not ready for the potential energy contained in an untamed Norris joke. Especially when it involves roundhouse kicks."

The announcement has caused a global uproar, with lawmakers scrambling to respond. Many governments have begun drafting legislation to regulate the use of Chuck Norris memes, dubbing it "The Chuck Norris Meme Control Act." 

"We simply cannot stand by while the world laughs itself into oblivion," declared UN Secretary-General Lucia Mbeki. "People must understand the gravity of the situation. Chuck Norris doesn’t read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants. You see? It's uncontrollable."

Public response to the imminent threat has been mixed. A certain faction of millennials and Gen Z, who find Chuck Norris jokes utterly hilarious, have protested the legislation, arguing that if the world is indeed to end, let it be while laughing at a Chuck Norris joke. Meanwhile, a burgeoning conspiracy theory posits that Chuck Norris himself is behind the clock's alarming forward movement, a claim Norris’s representatives have not responded to as of yet.

Meanwhile, scientists around the world are frantically searching for a solution to the impending doom. Some have suggested countering the Chuck Norris jokes with an equally powerful meme. The leading candidate? Jokes about how Steve Buscemi was a firefighter during 9/11. However, others believe the antidote could lie in a revival of the outdated, yet seemingly harmless, "Why did the chicken cross the road?" 

Only time will tell if humanity can curb its craving for the potent humor of Chuck Norris. However, as scientists, lawmakers, and meme creators grapple with the crisis, the world has been forced to consider a chilling truth - that a meme, particularly one about a legendary, roundhouse-kicking actor, could potentially hold the fate of the world in its punchline.
